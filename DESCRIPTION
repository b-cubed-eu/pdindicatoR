Description: A package to calculate and produce a map of phylogenetic diversity 
    scores for each grid cell in the input species occurences data cube, and 
    calculate the percentage of high PD cells within currently protected areas. 
    You provide a phylogenetic tree, the datacube for the corresponding species 
    is downloaded from GBIF (or user-uploaded), and the package does the rest.
