Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a measure of biodiversity which takes evolution into account. It is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the phylogenetic tree branches representing the minimum tree-spanning path among a group of species.
Phylogenetic diversity can be used in conservation planning to maximise a variety of features, meaning we do not aim to conserve specific features, but rather want to boost a diverse range of features. Conserving a variety of features could be particularly useful in light of the changing environmental conditions, as we can only guess which features will be important in the future.

In this package, we provide a workflow to calculate a metric that gives information about how well PD of a certain higher taxonomic group is currently safeguarded by protected areas and a spatial visualisation which can be used to identify potential directions for future expansion of protected areas.
