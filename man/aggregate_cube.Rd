\title{Aggregate datacube over grid cell to create new dataframe with species list per grid}
\usage{
aggregate_cube(mcube, timegroup = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcube}{An occurence datacube with appended ott_id's, as produced by the append_ott_id function}

\item{cube}{A dataframe with for selected taxa, the number of occurrences per
taxa and per grid cell}
}
\value{
A dataframe with for each grid cell
}
\description{
