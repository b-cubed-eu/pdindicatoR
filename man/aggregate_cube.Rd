\title{Aggregate datacube over grid cell to create new dataframe with species list per grid}
\usage{
aggregate_cube(mcube, timegroup = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcube}{An occurence datacube with appended ott_id's, as produced by the append_ott_id function}

\item{timegroup}{An integer, representing the number of years by which you want to group
your occurrence data}
}
\value{
A dataframe with for each grid cell
}
\description{
This function aggregates a provided datacube over grid cell id, so that a new datacube
is outputted with 3 variables that contain the lists of species that are observed for
each grid cell (as speciesKeys, ott_id's and names).
}
\examples{
ex_data <- retrieve_example_data()
mcube <- append_ott_id(ex_data$tree, ex_data$cube, ex_data$matched_nona)
mcube <- mcube \%>\% dplyr::filter(!is.na(ott_id))
aggr_cube <- aggregate_cube(mcube)
}
